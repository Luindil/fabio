# This is called hexversion since it only really looks meaningful when viewed as the result of passing it to the built-in hex() function. The version_info value may be used for a more human-friendly encoding of the same information.
#
# The hexversion is a 32-bit number with the following layout:
# Bits (big endian order)     Meaning
# 1-8     PY_MAJOR_VERSION (the 2 in 2.1.0a3)
# 9-16     PY_MINOR_VERSION (the 1 in 2.1.0a3)
# 17-24     PY_MICRO_VERSION (the 0 in 2.1.0a3)
# 25-28     PY_RELEASE_LEVEL (0xA for alpha, 0xB for beta, 0xC for release candidate and 0xF for final)
# 29-32     PY_RELEASE_SERIAL (the 3 in 2.1.0a3, zero for final releases)
#
# Thus 2.1.0a3 is hexversion 0x020100a3.
